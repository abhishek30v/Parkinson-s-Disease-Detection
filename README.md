# Parkinson-s-Disease-Detection
THIS IS A MACHINE LEARNING PROJECT FOR PARKINSON'S DISEASE PREDICTION

Overview->

This project involves:-

* Clustering: Using K-Means to identify different statuses of Parkinson's disease within the dataset.

* Classification: Applying various algorithms to predict the disease status.

* Final Model: Employing a classification algorithm for accurate disease predictions.


Workflow->
1) Data Preprocessing:-
* Load and standardize the dataset.

* Apply K-Means clustering for status identification.

2) Exploratory Data Analysis:-
* Visualize feature distributions and correlations.

3) Model Training:
* Train and evaluate Decision Tree, SVM, Random Forest, and XGBoost classifiers.

4) Prediction:
* Use the trained model to predict disease status for new inputs.


Technologies->

* Python
* Pandas
* Seaborn & Matplotlib
* Scikit-learn
* XGBoost


Results->

The classification report provides metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and the confusion matrix. Predictions are explicitly stated, indicating whether Parkinson's disease is present or not.
